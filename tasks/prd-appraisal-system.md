# Product Requirements Document: Smart Goals 360 Platform

## Introduction/Overview

Smart Goals 360 is a comprehensive employee performance management platform designed to streamline and digitize the entire performance lifecycle. The platform addresses the critical pain points of manual, paper-based performance review processes and lack of visibility into employee goals and progress by providing an integrated digital solution for HR administrators, managers, and employees.

The primary goal is to reduce HR administrative overhead while providing clear visibility into employee performance, goals, and organizational structure through automated workflows and centralized data management. The platform follows industry-standard performance appraisal methodologies (aligned with systems like PJIAE) and ensures compliance with labor agreements and audit requirements.

2. **Increase Goal Visibility**: Provide real-time visibility into employee goals, progress, and performance across all organizational levels
3. **Streamline Onboarding**: Reduce new organization setup time from weeks to hours through guided workflows
4. **Ensure Compliance**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails and digital signatures for all performance-related activities
5. **Improve User Experience**: Deliver an intuitive, role-based interface that requires minimal training
6. **Enable Appeals Process**: Provide structured workflows for employee feedback and formal appeals
7. **Support Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Ensure secure data isolation and customization for multiple organizations

## Appraisal Cycle Management

### Cycle Structure

**Phase 1: Goal Setting Period**

- Timing: Typically January-February for annual cycles
- Responsible Roles: Managers create goals, employees acknowledge
- Required Outputs: Completed goal forms with SMART criteria
- Approval Workflow: Manager → Division Director → HR (if required)

**Phase 2: Mid-Year Review (Optional)**

- Timing: Mid-point of appraisal cycle (June-July for annual)
- Responsible Roles: Managers and employees collaborate on progress assessment
- Required Outputs: Progress updates, revised goals if needed
- Approval Workflow: Manager → Employee acknowledgment

**Phase 3: Year-End Evaluation**

- Required Outputs: Completed appraisal forms with ratings and comments
- Approval Workflow: Employee self-assessment → Manager review → Division Director → HR → Employee signature

### Approval Workflows
