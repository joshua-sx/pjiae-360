-- Fix Security Definer View issue with perf_query_events
-- The issue: perf_query_events is a view that cannot have RLS policies applied directly
-- Solution: Drop the view and create a secure function-based approach

-- Drop the existing view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.perf_query_events;

-- Create a secure function to get performance query events
-- This function respects RLS on the underlying security_audit_log table

  _limit integer DEFAULT 100,
  _offset integer DEFAULT 0,

  created_at timestamp with time zone,
